	The New York Public Library's main branch was designed by architects, Carrere and Hastings, in the Beaux Arts style. 
	The library, with its impressive rooms, is a prominent city attraction that has been featured in many movies and TV shows over the years. 
	Although colloquially known as the main branch, the proper name is actually the Stephen A. Schwarzman building.
	It opened in 1911 to immediate acclaim. An enormous library, the Main Reading Room alone stretches two city blocks, 
  and the Periodicals Room holds 10,000 current magazines. The collection at this location is vast, to say the least.
