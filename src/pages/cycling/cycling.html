    <font color="Navy"> 
  About 50 miles north of New York City on the west bank of the Hudson River. 
  Hikers and cyclists relish the rugged scenery and endless choice of trails. 
  a vast wilderness that encompasses the 2,000 acres of wooded mountain terrain, 
  including a lake and river with fishing access. 
  A recommended hike is the 1.3-mile Bear Mountain Summit Loop up to the top of Bear Mountain. 
	The sweeping views from the summit make the one-hour uphill journey worthwhile.
