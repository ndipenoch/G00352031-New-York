    <font color="Navy">
	Bear Mountain State Park is a picturesque retreat in nature, about 50 miles north of New York City on the west bank of the Hudson River. 
	It takes about two hours to arrive here by train. Hikers and cyclists relish the rugged scenery and endless choice of trails. 
	More than 200 marked paths traverse the state park, a vast wilderness that encompasses the 2,000 acres of wooded mountain terrain, 
	including a lake and river with fishing access. A recommended hike is the 1.3-mile Bear Mountain Summit Loop up to the top of Bear Mountain. 
	The sweeping views from the summit make the one-hour uphill journey worthwhile.
