    <h1><marquee  ><font color="#000080">Summertime Fun in Coney Island.</font></marquee></h1>
    <font color="Navy">
	With its roller coaster rides and famous fairground foods, Coney Island is synonymous with summertime fun. 
	This iconic seaside destination, although not technically an island, is in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, 
	only 14 miles away from Manhattan, and easily accessible by subway. Epitomizing American popular culture, 
	the old-fashioned Amusement Park allows visitors to forget their cares and have a few hours of fun. 
	Besides the Amusement Park and Beach Boardwalk, Coney Island also has museums, film screenings, and circus performances.
