	 A walk, peddle, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central Park is a must-do on anyone's New York City itinerary. 
	 In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. This huge park in the city center, 
	 a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city. 
	 Besides being a great place to experience a little nature, Central Park has many attractions within its borders, including the Belvedere Castle, 
   Strawberry Fields, the Central Park Zoo, and the Lake.</font>
