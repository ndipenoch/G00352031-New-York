    <font color="Navy"> The Statue of Liberty was France's gift to America. Built in 1886, 
      it remains a famous world symbol of freedom and one of the greatest American icons. 
      It is one of the world's largest statues, standing just under 152 feet tall from the base to the torch, 
      and weighing approximately 450,000 pounds. 
      it's best to take a short boat trip to Liberty Island and see it up close. 
      You can walk around the base, enter the pedestal, or, with advance reservations, go right up to the crown.</font>
