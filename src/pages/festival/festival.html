    <h1><marquee  ><font color="#000080">Cherry Blossom Festival.</font></marquee></h1>
    <font color="Navy">
	The Brooklyn Botanic Garden has the most lavish celebration of cherry blossoms in the city. 
	This year, the festival takes place on Saturday, April 28 and Sunday, April 29 
	and includes Japanese cultural activities, music, and art. Kids enjoy sword-fighting play, 
	Taiko drumming, manga artists, workshops, a traditional Sohenryu tea ceremony, and, of course, 
	people dressed in Japanese costumes. The BBG's Cherry Blossom Festival draws huge crowds, 
	so consider visiting the garden's famous Cherry Blossom Esplanade earlier in the season. 
	Track the blossoms online to time your visit perfectly.
