    <font color="Navy">
  The Staten Island Ferry is one of the last remaining vestiges of an entire ferry system
   in New York City that transported people between Manhattan and its future boroughs 
   long before any bridges were built.
  Today the Staten Island Ferry provides 22 million people a year 
  (70,000 passengers a day not including weekend days) with ferry service between 
  St. George on Staten Island and Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan.
