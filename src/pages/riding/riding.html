    <font color="Navy">
	Make your way to the famous Tavern on the Green Restaurant, located in Central Park West. Meet your guide, 
	who will walk you through a safety briefing and orientation. You'll get matched with gentle horse and set off down the Bridle Path. 
	Follow your guide around the flat dirt trail that travels around the Central Park Reservoir (the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir).  
	Trot past the landmarks, monuments, and highlights in Central Park. Stop to snap photos of the Manhattan skyline looming above the greenery of the park. 
	Return to your starting point at the conclusion of your 1- or 2-hour ride.
