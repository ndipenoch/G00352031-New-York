	Lying in the shadow of Rockefeller Center is Radio City Music Hall, a famous entertainment venue and a designated city landmark. 
	This 1932 Art Deco theater offers musical extravaganzas and films and is the home of the dance company, The Rockettes. 
	The building was built and financed by the Rockefellers during the 1930s and contained the largest indoor theater in the world at the time. 
	Today, the venue frequently hosts major events, including the Grammy Awards and Tony Awards. 
	Its prominent marquee is hard to miss as it curves around the building and stretches down the block.
